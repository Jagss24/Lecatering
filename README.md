Catering services
I've made a clone website of LeCatering services by looking at the template in w3.css by using HTML & CSS . It helped in my dveloping my CSS skills much better.
One short tip while adding responsiveness to your website use padding for the left right corners instead of margin. It'll be easy and will save much time.
I learned these while making this website responsive. Hope will make more websites.
